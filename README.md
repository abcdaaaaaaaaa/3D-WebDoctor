# 3D Web Doctor

The system language is Turkish. You can <strong>contribute</strong> to us in other languages!

You can review our project at <strong>[doctor.uzay.info](https://doctor.uzay.info/)!</strong>

## How to use?
To use our project, you must first log in as a user and enter your pharmacy information. 

(The information you enter does not have to be real; you can use it for testing purposes only:))

When you open the home page, a login form will appear asking for your login information.

Warning: Please ensure you enter your sensitive information correctly. Sensitive information is stored in a specially encrypted format, and even if you enter the same information multiple times, the encryption algorithm will store it differently each time. You may intentionally enter your sensitive information incorrectly into our system, but if you cannot recall it (since not even the system owner has access to this information), you may not be able to log in to your account again.
